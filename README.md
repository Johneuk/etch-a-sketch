# etch-a-sketch

Welcome to my etch-a-sketch exercise

This project is for me to learn certain principles of the DOM-manipulation that can be done with JS.

It also taught me that complex HTML stuff must be done with JavaScript to even work.

After all: With this project, you can draw with your mouse inside a grid and create some beautiful artwork.
Give it a try!
